## C++ Basics

- [First program](./features/basics/first/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 1 (Completed):** [Geometry: Area of Triangle](./features/basics/math/geometry/area-perimeter/triangle-area/main.cpp)
    - **Find the area of a triangle**. This triangle area equation is from geometry in the area-perimeter section.
- **Coding Exercise 2 (Completed):** [Precalculus: Arithmetic Series Sum program](./features/basics/math/precalculus/series/arithmetic-series-sum/main.cpp)
    - **Find the Sum of a Finite Arithmetic Series**. Also known as `finding the Sum of n Natural Numbers`.
- **Coding Exercise 3 (Completed):** [Algebra: Quadratic Formula](./features/basics/math/algebra/quadratic-eqs-fun/quadratic-formula/main.cpp)
    - **Find roots of quadratic equations**
- **Coding Exercise 4 (Completed):** [Physics: Displacement program](./features/basics/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/displacement/main.cpp)
    - **Finding the displacement** is an area of Physics in one dimensional motion from kinematic formulas. We look at the displacement that happened while the particle achieved magnitude of final velocity `vf` from initial velocity `vi`. In Abdul Bari's course, he wrote it down as finding speed, but that was not correct.
- **Coding Exercise 5 (Completed):** [Economics: Simple Interest program](./features/finance-capital-markets/interest-debt/simple-interest/main.cpp)
    - **Finding Simple Interest** is an area of Economics in Finance Capital Markets from Interest Debt. Simple Interest is the amount of money you owe after borrowing P principle for T years at R rate.
- **Coding Exercise 6 (Completed):** [Geometry: Cylinder Volume program](./features/basics/math/geometry/volume-surface-area/cylinder-volume/main.cpp)
    - **Find the volume of a cylinder** is an area of Geometry in volume surface area from cylinder volume.
- **Coding Exercise 7 (Completed):** [Geometry: Distance Formula program](./features/basics/math/geometry/pythagorean-theorem/distance-formula/main.cpp)
    - **Find the distance between 2 points** is an area of Geometry in pythagorean theorem from distance formula.
- [Programming: Operators - Compound Assignment program](./features/basics/operators/compound-assignment/main.cpp)
    - **Use Compound Assignment** is an area of programming operators from compound assignment. For this example, the plus compound assignment operator `+=` is used to add a certain amount based on a variable `x` to the `sum` variable.
- [Programming: Operators - Increment and Decrement program](./features/basics/operators/inc-dec/main.cpp)
    - **Use increment and decrement** operators is an area of programming operators from increment and decrement. For this example, the post and pre increment opertors `x++` and `++x` are used.
- [Programming: Overflow Protection](./features/basics/overflow/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Overflow protection**. For this example, we look into overflow protection for `char` and `int` variables.
- [Programming: Bitwsise Operators](./features/basics/bitwise-operators/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Bitwise Operators**. For this example, we look at the bitwise `&` and, `|` or, `^` exclusive or, `<<` shift left, `>>` shift right and `~` complement operators.
- [Programming: Enum and Typedef program](./features/basics/enum-typedef/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Enum and Typedef**. For this example, we look at `enum` and renaming an `int` data type to `marks` for improving readability.
- **Student Exercise #1 (Completed):** [Find Area of Circle](./features/basics/math/geometry/area-perimeter/circle-area/main.cpp)
    - **Find area of a circle**. This circle-area equation comes from geometry in area-perimeter section.
- **Student Exercise #2 (Completed):** [Find Net Salary](./features/basics/life-skills/personal-finance/income-benefits/paycheck/net-salary/main.cpp)
    - **Find Net Salary**. This net salary equation is an area of life skills in personal finance -> income-benefits -> paycheck. We go over an example of how to compute the net salary from the basic salary, percent of allowances and deductions.
