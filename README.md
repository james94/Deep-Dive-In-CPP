    - **Find roots of quadratic equations**
- **Coding Exercise 4 (Completed):** [Physics: Displacement program](./features/basics/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/displacement/main.cpp)
    - **Finding the displacement** is an area of Physics in one dimensional motion from kinematic formulas. We look at the displacement that happened while the particle achieved magnitude of final velocity `vf` from initial velocity `vi`. In Abdul Bari's course, he wrote it down as finding speed, but that was not correct.
- **Coding Exercise 5 (Completed):** [Economics: Simple Interest program](./features/finance-capital-markets/interest-debt/simple-interest/main.cpp)
    - **Finding Simple Interest** is an area of Economics in Finance Capital Markets from Interest Debt. Simple Interest is the amount of money you owe after borrowing P principle for T years at R rate.
- **Coding Exercise 6 (Completed):** [Geometry: Cylinder Volume program](./features/basics/math/geometry/volume-surface-area/cylinder-volume/main.cpp)
    - **Find the volume of a cylinder** is an area of Geometry in volume surface area from cylinder volume.
- **Coding Exercise 7 (Completed):** [Geometry: Distance Formula program](./features/basics/math/geometry/pythagorean-theorem/distance-formula/main.cpp)
    - **Find the distance between 2 points** is an area of Geometry in pythagorean theorem from distance formula.
- [Programming: Operators - Compound Assignment program](./features/basics/operators/compound-assignment/main.cpp)
    - **Use Compound Assignment** is an area of programming operators from compound assignment. For this example, the plus compound assignment operator `+=` is used to add a certain amount based on a variable `x` to the `sum` variable.
- [Programming: Operators - Increment and Decrement program](./features/basics/operators/inc-dec/main.cpp)
    - **Use increment and decrement** operators is an area of programming operators from increment and decrement. For this example, the post and pre increment opertors `x++` and `++x` are used.
- [Programming: Overflow Protection](./features/basics/overflow/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Overflow protection**. For this example, we look into overflow protection for `char` and `int` variables.
- [Programming: Bitwsise Operators](./features/basics/bitwise-operators/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Bitwise Operators**. For this example, we look at the bitwise `&` and, `|` or, `^` exclusive or, `<<` shift left, `>>` shift right and `~` complement operators.
- [Programming: Enum and Typedef program](./features/basics/enum-typedef/main.cpp)
    - **Exploring Enum and Typedef**. For this example, we look at `enum` and renaming an `int` data type to `marks` for improving readability.
- **Student Exercise #1 (Completed):** [Find Area of Circle](./features/basics/math/geometry/area-perimeter/circle-area/main.cpp)
    - **Find area of a circle**. This circle-area equation comes from geometry in area-perimeter section.
- **Student Exercise #2 (Completed):** [Find Net Salary](./features/basics/life-skills/personal-finance/income-benefits/paycheck/net-salary/main.cpp)
    - **Find Net Salary**. This net salary equation is an area of life skills in personal finance -> income-benefits -> paycheck. We go over an example of how to compute the net salary from the basic salary, percent of allowances and deductions.
- **Quiz (Completed)**: [C++ Basics Quiz](./features/basics/Quiz.md)

## Conditional Statements

- **Coding Exercise 8 (Completed):** [Finding Max of 2 Numbers](./features/conditional-statements/max/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 9 (Completed):** [Number is Positive or Negative](./features/conditional-statements/sign/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 10 (Completed):** [Number is Odd or Even](./features/conditional-statements/odd-even/main.cpp)
- [Is RollNo Valid?](./features/conditional-statements/rollno-valid/main.cpp)
- [Is Division Valid?](./features/conditional-statements/division-valid/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 11 (Completed):** [Check If Working Hours](./features/conditional-statements/check-is-working/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 12 (Completed):** [Check Age of a Person](./features/conditional-statements/check-age/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 13 (Completed):** [Check if Person is Eligible for an Offer](./features/conditional-statements/eligible/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 14 (Completed):** [Find Maximum of 3 numbers](./features/conditional-statements/find-max-of-3-num/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 15 (Completed):** [Find Nature of Quadratic Roots](./features/conditional-statements/nature-quadratic-roots/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 16 (Completed):** [Display Grades for Student Marks](./features/conditional-statements/display-grade-marks/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 17 (Completed):** [Calculate Discounted Bill Amount](./features/conditional-statements/discount-bill/main.cpp)
- **Coding Exercise 18 and 21 (Completed):** [Display Day Name](./features/conditional-statements/display-day-name/main.cpp)
    - This example shows how to check the day using if, else if and else and alternatively, it does this using switch case statements too. Then once the day is found, it displays the name.
- **Coding Exercise 19 (Completed):** [Display Month Name](./features/conditional-statements/display-month-name/main.cpp)

- **Student Exercise #4 (Completed):** [Check if leap year](./features/conditional-statements/check-if-leap-year/main.cpp)
    - There was a student exercise #3 on finding the discounted bill amount, but that was very similar to coding exercise 17, so I did not include it here.
